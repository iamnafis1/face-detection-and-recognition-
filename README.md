Project: Face Detection and Recognition
Description:

This Python project leverages computer vision techniques to detect and recognize human faces in images or real-time video streams. It utilizes the OpenCV library, a powerful computer vision toolkit, to perform these tasks efficiently.

Key Features:

Face Detection: Accurately locates human faces within images or video frames.
Face Recognition: Identifies individuals based on their facial features, comparing them against a known database.
Real-time Processing: Enables face detection and recognition in real-time applications, such as surveillance systems or access control.
Customizable: Allows for customization of parameters like detection threshold, recognition algorithm, and database management.
Prerequisites:

Python: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
OpenCV: Install OpenCV using pip: pip install opencv-python
Additional Libraries: Depending on your specific requirements, you might need to install other libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, or TensorFlow.
Usage:

Clone the Repository: Download the project files from your GitHub repository.
Prepare Data: Create a database of images with labeled faces for training the recognition model.
Run the Script: Execute the main Python script, which typically contains functions for face detection, recognition, and visualization.
Customize: Modify the script's parameters to adjust the detection and recognition behavior based on your needs.
